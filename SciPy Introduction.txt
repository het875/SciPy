What is SciPy?
    SciPy is a scientific computation library that uses NumPy underneath.

    SciPy stands for Scientific Python.

    It provides more utility functions for optimization, stats and signal processing.

    Like NumPy, SciPy is open source so we can use it freely.

    SciPy was created by NumPy's creator Travis Olliphant.

üìå 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is SciPy?
SciPy extends NumPy and provides additional functionality for:
    ‚úÖ Mathematical Functions (e.g., integrals, derivatives)
    ‚úÖ Linear Algebra (e.g., solving equations, eigenvalues)
    ‚úÖ Optimization (e.g., finding min/max values of functions)
    ‚úÖ Statistics (e.g., distributions, hypothesis testing)
    ‚úÖ Signal Processing (e.g., filters, Fourier transforms)
    ‚úÖ Interpolation (e.g., smooth curves between data points)




Why Use SciPy?
        If SciPy uses NumPy underneath, why can we not just use NumPy?

        SciPy has optimized and added functions that are frequently used in NumPy and Data Science.



Which Language is SciPy Written in?
    SciPy is predominantly written in Python, but a few segments are written in C.




Installation of SciPy
    If you have Python and PIP already installed on a system, then installation of SciPy is very easy.

    Install it using this command:

    C:\Users\Your Name>pip install scipy

    If this command fails, then use a Python distribution that already has SciPy installed like, Anaconda, Spyder etc.



Checking SciPy Version
The version string is stored under the __version__ attribute.

Example
    import scipy

    print(scipy.__version__)
